# notetaker

## Description

- The notetaker is an app that creates notes, gets previous notes, and deletes notes. I enjoyed working on this app because it helped me understand GET, POST, and DELETE routes much better. 
- One of the challenges I had working on this app was debugging the routes and understanding how the files should be organized. There were many small, tedious bugs that prevented the app from working but I'm proud of myself for figuring them out without any help!
